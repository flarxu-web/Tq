# Tq Demo — Azure-like Static Template

This repository contains a responsive HTML/CSS/JS marketing template inspired by Azure's marketing pages. It includes long demo content and a JSON file with full demo data to populate sections (solutions, blog posts, testimonials, FAQs).

Files included:
- `index.html` — main demo page
- `styles.css` — styling and responsive rules
- `scripts.js` — small client-side script to load `demo-data.json` and populate sections
- `demo-data.json` — long demo dataset (services, blog posts, testimonials, faqs)

How to use
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Serve the files from a static server (some browsers block fetch requests from `file://`):
   - Quick Python server:
     - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
     - Python 2: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
   - Or use VS Code Live Server extension.
3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

Customize
- Edit `demo-data.json` to change the populated content.
- Update `styles.css` to match your brand colors and typography.
- Replace `index.html` markup sections or replicate components to build additional pages.

Accessibility & performance
- This demo uses semantic elements (header, nav, section).
- For production, optimize images, add meta tags for sharing, and implement server-side rendering if required.

License
- This is a demo template. Use freely for prototypes and demos. No warranty — inspect before production use.

Want changes?
- If you'd like variants (dark mode, additional pages, Tailwind/Bootstrap versions, or a React/Vue port), tell me what you prefer and I can generate the files.
